* INSTRUCTIONS: Check that your 1 kHz sinusoidal input voltage amplitude is below 100mV and the output voltage is also sinusoidal (not slew rate limited). Measure the gain.
* SIMULATION NOTES: For the purposes of simulation, set the amplitude of the input signal to exactly 100mV. The simulation time should be 2 milliseconds
* IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: When this lab is opened, the relay controlling the power supply (Power - Port 1 Line 3 - ON) will switch ON, and the relay controlling the feedback resistor will switch to RF1 (S2 - Port 0 Line 1 OFF). Upon successful completion of this lab, the Function generator switch will turn ON (S1 - Port 0 Line 0 ON). All capacitance switches (S3 - Port 0 Line 2 - OFF)(S4 - Port 0 Line 4 - OFF)(S5 - Port 0 Line 5 - OFF) will remain OFF
