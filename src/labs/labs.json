You have been provided with every node necessary for constructing the circuit. Joining nodes will produce an error.\n* IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: When this lab is opened, the relay controlling the power supply (Power - Port 1 Line 3 - ON) will switch ON. Once your circuit has been constructed, it will be checked against a set of possible valid implementations. If your circuit matches, it will be implemented on the hardware\n* DIGOUTPUT0_PRE = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n* DIGOUTPUT1_PRE = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n* DIGOUTPUT0_POST = 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n* DIGOUTPUT1_POST = 0 0 0

Finally, plot the phase frequency response\n* SIMULATION NOTES: Perform a frequency sweep of the circuit given. This will require configuring the virtual oscilloscope. Run the sweep up to 1MHz with decade time steps and 1 step per decade.\n* IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: When this lab is opened, the relay controlling the power supply (Power - Port 1 Line 3 - ON) will switch ON, and the relay controlling the feedback resistor will switch to RF2 [unity gain] (S2 - Port 0 Line 1 ON). Upon successful completion of this lab, the Function generator switch will turn ON (S1 - Port 0 Line 0 ON). Capacitor 1 will Switch ON (S3 - Port 0 Line 2 - ON) All other capacitance switches (S4 - Port 0 Line 4 - OFF)(S5 - Port 0 Line 5 - OFF) will remain OFF\n* DIGOUTPUT0_PRE = 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n*

construct, simulate and implement a circuit in any way within the constraints of the hardware. You have been provided with every node necessary for constructing the circuit. Joining nodes will produce an error.\n* IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: When this lab is opened, the relay controlling the power supply (Power - Port 1 Line 3 - ON) will switch ON. Once your circuit has been constructed, it will be checked against a set of possible valid implementations. If your circuit matches, it will be implemented on the hardware\n* DIGOUTPUT0_PRE = 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n* DIGOUTPUT1_PRE = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n* DIGOUTPUT0_POST = 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n* DIGOUTPUT1_POST = 0 0 0

INSTRUCTIONS: Creative mode allows you to construct, simulate and implement a circuit in any way within the constraints of the hardware. You have been provided with every node necessary for constructing the circuit. Joining nodes will produce an error.\n* IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: When this lab is opened, the relay controlling the power supply (Power - Port 1 Line 3 - ON) will switch ON. Once your circuit has been constructed, it will be checked against a set of possible valid implementations.

constraints of the hardware. You have been provided with every node necessary for constructing the circuit. Joining nodes will produce an error.\n* IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: When this lab is opened, the relay controlling the power supply (Power - Port 1 Line 3 - ON) will switch ON. Once your circuit has been constructed, it will be checked against a set of possible valid implementations.
