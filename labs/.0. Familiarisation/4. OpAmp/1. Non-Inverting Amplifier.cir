* INSTRUCTIONS: Configure the Signal Generator to produce a 1kHz Sine Wave at 1V (with no DC or phase offset). Using the components provided, construct an inverting amplifier that produces a 10V, 1kHz Sine Wave at the output. Validate your design through simulation.\nThe OPAMP available in this laboratory is identical to the LM101A; the datasheet is available in Appendix B of the Laboratory Manual
